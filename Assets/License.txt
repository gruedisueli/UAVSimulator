Airspace map GIS data is publicly-available here, published by the FAA: https://adds-faa.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/faa::class-airspace/about [accessed 6/23/2022]
Please note that this data is not official, and is not updated dynamically. Adding this data to our tool requires downloading the dataset and uploading it to our own private Mapbox tileset. Newer data may exist than what you see, since the FAA updates the GIS dataset every 8 weeks.

Wording of license from the above website:
The data provided is for public use. A limited number of Non-US Landing Facilities are included in this file. Some of these, in particular the Canadian facilities, are included to facilitate cartographic requirements in border regions. These records are not guaranteed to be complete and are not inclusive of all Canadian facilities. This airport data should not be considered official source for non-US facilities. Please contact the appropriate authority for more accurate and updated non-US airports data.
